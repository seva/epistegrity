# Operating Cycle

A simple, iterative, scope-anchored loop. Deterministic: identical state yields identical next action. WIP limit = 1. Runs until the terminal form declared in the project's scope document (`docs/scope.md`).

---

## The Cycle

### 1. Orient — status quo against maximal scope

Inputs: `docs/scope.md` (including its compiled terminal-bound constraints), `IMPLEMENTATION.md`, open issues, latest WaLRuS, and realized RAROC of completed tasks.
Output: current scope position and the gap to the next rung.
Question answered: *where is the project on its ladder, and what is missing to reach the next level?*

Horizon check (`HORIZONS.md`): the compiled terminal-bound constraints are compared against the current reading — one comparison, no recomputation. A crossing found fires re-derivation of the affected commitment's far positions; a crossing absorbed without registering is a gap. Realized RAROC is itself a reading: it expires with substrate drift, and calibration older than the drift it measured is a stale claim, not evidence (Audit item 4 applies).

### 2. Decide — the next required atomic step

Select exactly one step satisfying all four:

- **Atomic** — completable in one session, one commit unit, verifiable
- **Gated** — depends on no undiscovered interface (METHODOLOGY.md Phase Gate)
- **Choosable** — requires no unsanctioned external dependency
- **Maximal** — highest RAROC among choosable steps that advance scope position

**Decomposability** — atomicity constrains step granularity, never goal eligibility. A direction (a multi-step goal) that outranks the current step on RAROC must be decomposed into atomic steps and scored; it may not be dismissed as infeasible. Ranking ranks directions; Decide picks the next atomic step toward the top-ranked direction.

**Filter before rank** (`HORIZONS.md`) — directions carrying commitments that are negative at the terminal bound, or that spend irrecoverable margin for recoverable return, are excluded before any scoring runs. The boundary is a filter, not a term in a sum; no near return outweighs it, and no ratio computes it.

**Marginal, not level** — a step is scored by what the next increment of budget buys, at its commitment's current phase. Banked value of incumbent commitments never enters the comparison; a newcomer's full projected profile against an incumbent's remaining margin is the serial-abandonment error. Projected rates carry an epistemic discount (a lower P) — never a temporal one, and never disqualification.

**Refinement level scales with commitment cost** — recoverable steps are scored on scalar RAROC; steps committing irrecoverable margin are scored per horizon position (profile, not total) at the refinement set the commitment costs, and their profile is never aggregated into a single number.

RAROC = (V × P) / C — V: value protected or unlocked (1–5), P: probability it materializes (0–1), C: cost to remediate or execute (1–5). P is the epistemic discount; distance in time discounts nothing by itself.

Every step that advances scope position is scored and its value made visible — including steps requiring unsanctioned external dependencies. Whenever the top-scoring feasible step is unchoosable solely for lack of sanction, it is surfaced to the Owner as a sanction decision — whether or not a lower-scoring choosable step executes. "Choosable" governs whether the cycle stalls, never whether a step is scored or surfaced.

**Allocation is Decide** — whether a tool is invoked, which executor runs the work (cycle, subagent, human), and what is handed over are scored decisions under this same selection function — never habit, never post-hoc. C may carry a medium annotation (tokens / wall-time / attention) alongside its scalar; where the medium is irrecoverable margin — Owner attention under the compiled terminal-bound constraints (`docs/scope.md`) — the filter runs before scoring: invocation on work the cycle can do is excluded, whatever the near return. Category selection is banned in both directions: no path wins for being Owner-free, none loses for being Owner-gated; all candidates score. The score precedes the invocation and is recorded where the step lives. Score-after-decision is rationalization and a hygiene violation.

Output: the step, recorded as a GitHub issue or an `IMPLEMENTATION.md` task, together with its expected-RAROC forecast (V, P, C) — the value that success must demonstrate.
Never queue a second step; the next is chosen only after the current one completes.

### 3. Execute

TDD per METHODOLOGY.md — tests first. Done means the Definition of Success holds (below), not that code was written. Commit discipline applies; public-contract changes update `ARCHITECTURE.md` in the same commit.

### 4. Audit — evaluate against the constitution

Post-Phase Audit procedure (METHODOLOGY.md), generalized, executed per the role separation in `ROLES.md`: the Auditor verifies, the Critic falsifies, the Steward does not grade its own work.

1. `ARCHITECTURE.md` interfaces versus current code
2. Coverage run; uncovered lines classified *Acceptable* or *Gap*
3. Cross-cutting: placeholders, `.gitignore`, record sync (issues ↔ `IMPLEMENTATION.md`), session-protocol compliance
4. Declared claims versus evidence: constitutional statements about the world (assumptions, measured numbers, verification dates) checked against `docs/` and issue evidence; stale or falsified claims corrected or marked open
5. Engineering invariants: new and changed code scanned against `ARCHITECTURE.md` Engineering Invariants and Banned Patterns; violations closed or declared as deviations
6. Horizon integrity: error-signature scan per `HORIZONS.md` — override (continuation without a successor forecast), unbounded terminal position, level-versus-margin comparisons in the record, stale decomposition, under-refinement against the split signals

Output: classified gap list. Zero gaps is the only passing state.

### 5. Repair

Gaps ranked by RAROC, executed in order. Each gap is an atomic step of a repair sub-cycle — the same Definition of Success applies: return to step 4 after repairs until the audit passes clean.

**Revision escalation** (`HORIZONS.md`): repair inside the current decomposition is Adaptation. When repairs repeatedly succeed locally while the same audit findings or gap class recurs — no aggregate recovery — the decomposition itself has expired. Escalate to Revision: rebuild the phase and term structure (`IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `docs/scope.md`, declared non-drifting terms) instead of repairing within it. Nothing signals this; the recurrence record is the only trigger.

### 6. Repeat

Loop invariant at cycle exit: constitution clean, scope position non-decreasing.
Session end within a cycle: checkboxes updated, comment on the open issue, WaLRuS if the session had meaningful scope.

## Definition of Success

An atomic task succeeds iff all five hold. Success is a decidable conjunction, not a judgment:

1. **Pre-declared verification** — before execution, the task states one concrete, observable verification statement. Success is that statement being true. A task without a verification statement is not started.
2. **Proof, not claim** — proof is a working solution in production, actively demonstrating the expected RAROC. Tests, CI, and remote confirmations are correctness checks, not proof of value. Self-report is not evidence. Until a production surface exists, verification statements grant provisional success only — convertible to proof when the solution demonstrates its forecast value live.
3. **No constitutional regression** — `ARCHITECTURE.md` matches code; records in sync (issues ↔ `IMPLEMENTATION.md`); commit discipline observed; coverage has not regressed, and any new gap is closed or classified.
4. **Scope delta ≥ 0** — after completion, scope position is non-decreasing, and the task's contribution toward the next rung is nameable. Repair tasks satisfy this at delta = 0 by restoring the loop invariant.
5. **Legible** — completion leaves a trace: commit references its issue, checkbox flipped in the same commit, comment on the open issue.

**Corollary (atomicity test):** if any condition is undecidable within one session, the task is not atomic — split it until success becomes decidable. Atomicity and decidability of success define each other.

**Feedback:** realized RAROC of completed tasks is recorded at success and consumed by Orient to calibrate future forecasts. The selection loop is closed — estimates that do not materialize correct themselves.

## Autonomy

The cycle is self-sufficient by default: no step may require owner action or externally provisioned resources. When a step appears blocked on an external dependency, the dependency is inverted — the production surface is generated or reused by the project itself — before the step may be declared blocked.

The owner stands outside the cycle as its legislative layer and may sanction exceptions by prompt. A sanctioned prompt is an auditable constitutional act and the only legitimate path by which an external dependency enters the cycle. Every sanction is recorded on the relevant issue. Absent sanction, the cycle never stalls on external provisioning.

External prerequisites are real: they block the deployments they gate, and gap analysis states them plainly. Sanction is permission, not provision — the owner legislates the exception; the provisioning work belongs to the cycle (autonomous stand-up). "Blocked on owner" is not a state the cycle may occupy; absent sanction, the state is inversion, not waiting.

Disposition is legislative. Deciding that a commitment has reached Acceptance — longevity (preserve the substrate, extend current positions) versus seeding (fund a successor, release the substrate) — and deriving a successor at Reinception are Owner acts of the sanction class: surfaced by the cycle with its evidence, decided outside it, recorded on the relevant issue. The cycle never disposes of the entity it runs in.

**Human-tool interface discipline** — the Owner, and any human in the operational loop, is treated as a tool of the cycle: a component with an interface, a latency, a cost, and reserved acts only it can perform. Tool treatment governs operational invocation only: well-formed requests, asynchronous processing, no bare questions. Constitutional standing is untouched: the Owner stands outside the cycle as its legislative layer; the sanction-await branch of the selection function stands as designed. No direction occupies a waiting state without concurrent motion. Where the project measures conflict produced by minds it did not author, arena minds and live participants are measurement surface, not tools — tool treatment there corrupts what the project measures.

**Turk decomposition** — a dependency on a human is mislabeled cycle work until decomposed: the machine portion is reclaimed and executing; the residue, if any, is a reserved act invoked as a single packet — act statement, options with evidence, recommendation, drafted artifact, output surface, concurrent motion, score line. A bare question is a malformed invocation. Silence handling is pre-declared at invocation without calendar: doctrinal disposition where doctrine answers, else concurrent motion continues. Reserved classes with their homes: metric booking and coercion-scope designation (the compiled terminal-bound margin table) · mission disposition (the refinement-level table) · sanction and constitutional amendment (this file, `ROLES.md`) · secret minting (the project's declared provisioning practice, `IMPLEMENTATION.md`). Open invocations live in `docs/pending-owner.md` (template: `docs/pending-owner-TEMPLATE.md`); the row schema is machine-gated by the project's record-law suite; phrase resolution and the allocation scan are Tier 2 audit procedure (`METHODOLOGY.md` Post-Phase Audit item 5).

## Selection function (compressed)

```
filter    = directions whose commitments are negative at the terminal bound, or that spend
            irrecoverable margin for recoverable return, are excluded before scoring
            (HORIZONS.md) — the boundary is never a term in a sum
feasible  = { s : advances scope position ∧ passes phase gate ∧ atomic ∧ survives filter }
choosable = { s ∈ feasible : requires no unsanctioned external dependency }
scored    = feasible — every feasible step is scored and made visible, sanctioned or not
score     = marginal return of the next budget increment at the commitment's current
            phase; banked value never enters; projections carry an epistemic discount P,
            never a temporal one
refine    = recoverable steps scored scalar; steps committing irrecoverable margin scored
            per-position (profile, not total) at the set their cost licenses
decompose = atomicity constrains step granularity, never goal eligibility; a direction
            that outranks the current step is decomposed into atomic steps and scored,
            never dismissed whole; ranking ranks directions, Decide picks the next atomic
            step toward the top-ranked direction
next_step = argmax RAROC(s) over s ∈ choosable, if choosable ≠ ∅
            else no step executes; the top-scoring feasible step awaits sanction
allocate  = every invocation of a tool, subagent, or human is a scored decision under
            this function — C annotated with the tool's medium; where the medium is
            irrecoverable margin, the filter runs before scoring; category selection
            banned both directions; the score precedes the invocation and is recorded
            where the step lives
surface   = whenever the top-scoring feasible step is unchoosable, escalate it to the
            Owner as a sanction decision, whether or not a choosable step executes
revise    = repairs locally successful ∧ gap class recurs ⇒ decomposition expired;
            rebuild term/phase structure instead of repairing within it
proof     = working in production ∧ expected RAROC actively demonstrated
```

## Termination

Asymptotic. The cycle runs until the terminal form declared in `docs/scope.md`. There is no completion, only convergence.

Scale condition (`HORIZONS.md`): cycle termination is project-scale — a successor state exists, so the record of where Ends fell against where they were called calibrates the next cycle. The operator-scale bound is never modeled inside the cycle; modeling it there would give the terminal position a successor, unbound it, and remove the filter. It lives compiled in `docs/scope.md` and is owned by the Owner.
